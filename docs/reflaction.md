 #GitHub is a great tool that help code devolpers team to work togather virtually and orginized the tasks between them  and all other features that makes executing the project easily and effectvely such as 
make changes in the same time by 2 devolpers and without conflicting the work. 
and with project feature it help to break the project taskes into smaller pices by using some templates that help us to divide the task between us and track the process of the project
using Github in the beginging it seems complicated but when we start to use it become easier. 
and it fun because it has all the features that makes the work easier and clear.
one of the challenges we faced was that we didnt really know how to use the github desktop but then realize that it was faster and closer to the user as it understands and knows what the user want to do exactly from pulling and pushing and commiting to the repo. The idea could be improved to have a better UI such as showing the planet the user chooses.
